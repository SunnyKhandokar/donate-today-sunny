                your donation</h1>
            <p> Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and diaper banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.The value of life is not in its duration.But in its donation.You are not important because of how long you live.You are important because of how effective you live.Charity and donations often help the recipients put a “band-aid” over their true problems. It then causes the recipients to become dependent on aid and inhibit their self sufficiency that they are capable of. In addition, charity undermines a recipients efforts in generating their own profits.</p>
